# Maplibre GeoJSON toggle map

### This repository stores code that produces a map that renders GeoJSON data and allows users to subset data. 

### Here is a live version of the map: https://casmacdo.github.io/maplibre_toggle_map/


### Below, I describe how site works üòä

The webpage uses Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This repository's root directory stores files that are used to produce the website. index.html is the html file that user's browsers render, style.css is the cascading style sheet document that defines styles for html features that I created, ott.geojson is the equity data that I downloaded from the Ottawa open data portal and is displayed on the map, cocco.jpeg is an image of my dog üê∂ that I used for the favicon, geocoder.js is a javascript file that I used for a geocoder that is not currently included in the live site, and .gitignore is a file that tells git which files to not include in commits, pushes, etc. For example, if cocco.jpeg were listed in .gitignore, this picture would not be included in git commits or sent to github.
